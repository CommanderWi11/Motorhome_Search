## 2026-08-13 — Dashboard visual redesign (warm editorial minimalism)

Luis (via `/goal`): "improve the design of the dashboard to make it modern,
minimalist and slick... you make any choices." Done autonomously, no design
doc — a styling/markup pass, not a data-model or pipeline change.

**What changed** (`docs/index.html`, `docs/style.css`, `docs/app.js` only —
`board.py`/`apply_winners.py`/`harvest.py`/`research-prompt.md` untouched):
- Typography: Fraunces (display serif, via Google Fonts) for headings/prices,
  IBM Plex Sans for body — replaces system-font stack.
- Palette: copper/terracotta accent (`--accent`) replaces the old teal;
  flatter hairline-bordered cards (10px radius, no heavy shadow) replace the
  old 20px-radius shadow-heavy bubble cards.
- **Real light AND dark theme**, both intentionally designed
  (`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`), not left to the browser. Worth
  knowing for next time: this Chrome profile has `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
  genuinely true (confirmed via `matchMedia` in a live page eval), and with no
  `color-scheme` declared, Chrome was silently repainting the old light-only
  design with its own heuristic — uncontrolled and untested. Declaring
  `color-scheme: light dark` on `:root` plus a real dark variable set fixes
  that. **Real bug this caught**: two spots (`.rank-badge`, `.btn-star.active`)
  used `var(--paper-raised)` for "light text on a colored fill" — correct
  only in light mode. In dark mode `--paper-raised` itself goes dark, making
  that text invisible. Fixed with a dedicated `--on-accent` variable that
  stays light in both themes (text-on-saturated-fill doesn't need to flip).
- Rank badges (`01`–`05`, only when `listing.rank` is set) overlaid on the
  photo for Top 5 cards — leans into the board's actual "ranked leaderboard"
  nature.
- Empty-photo state (~1 in 5 listings in practice, `docs/listings.json`'s own
  rank-2 winner included) now shows a bespoke inline-SVG camper silhouette on
  a subtle diagonal-stripe pattern, replacing the bare 🚐 emoji.
- Card entrance is staggered per grid via a `--stagger` CSS custom property
  set from each card's array index (`Array.map`'s free second argument, no
  call-site changes needed) — respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No functional/DOM-contract changes: `data-id`, the event-delegation classes
  (`.btn-star`, `.btn-delete`), and the `img.photo` → `.photo--empty` sibling
  adjacency the `onerror` fallback depends on are all unchanged.

**Validation**: full pytest (50) + `node --test` (5) suites re-run clean
(neither touches `docs/`, so this is a sanity check, not real coverage — this
project has no visual/JS test harness). Real verification was manual: served
`docs/` locally, drove it with playwriter, checked both forced-light and
native-dark rendering, scrolled through Top5/Favoritos/History sections,
confirmed console-clean, checked a 390px mobile viewport. Then pushed and
re-verified live (zero console errors, screenshot matches local preview).

**Two playwriter gotchas hit and worth remembering:**
1. **Stale Service Workers survive across projects sharing a port.** A local
   preview on `localhost:8743` kept rendering a *different* project's cached
   page (Family_Trip_Japan) even though `curl` correctly saw this project's
   files — a Service Worker registered by an earlier session's dev server on
   that same port was still installed for the `localhost:8743` origin and
   intercepted every browser navigation, regardless of what's actually
   listening on the port now. `curl` bypasses Service Workers entirely, so it
   is not a reliable way to confirm what a real browser will render — plain
   HTTP success there does not mean the browser sees the same thing. Fix used:
   switch to a fresh, never-used port rather than touch the SW registration.
   If a future local-preview check ever shows unexplained stale/wrong
   content, suspect this before suspecting the code.
2. **`acquirePage` can hand back an unrelated real tab.** A generic
   `acquirePage({purpose: ...})` call (not reusing the tab this project
   already owned from a prior verification step) landed on a completely
   different, real tab of Luis's — his Japan trip planner — and a subsequent
   `goto()` navigated it away. Recovered with `page.goBack()`, no lasting
   harm, but the lesson: prefer reusing an already-owned/tracked
   `state.page` (or navigating a tab whose URL you just confirmed) over
   calling `acquirePage` again mid-session.
3. **Local previews are NOT sandboxed from the real backend.** Clicking
   ★ Favorito during local-preview testing wrote a real star to the actual
   Supabase project (`docs/config.js`'s credentials aren't origin-restricted)
   — a real, unintended mutation to Luis's live favorites, caught and
   reverted immediately (confirmed via reload that the count returned to 5).
   Do not click any state-mutating button (★, 🗑) during design/preview
   testing, local or live — verify interactivity structurally (event
   listeners, DOM classes) instead, never by actually triggering a write.

## 2026-08-13 — History view dedup + integral-over-perfilada preference

Luis: the History view (dated manual-shortlist sections below Top5/Favoritos)
was showing the same caravan repeated across every date it was mentioned in —
up to 13 separate date sections for one listing. Also asked to favor integral
(Class-A) motorhomes over perfiladas going forward, without skipping a genuinely
good perfilada deal. Design doc:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-history-dedup-and-integral-preference-design.md`.

**Why:** the History view's `renderHistory()` had no memory across dated
snapshots — every date rendered independently, so a vehicle held over unchanged
across many pasted reports got a fresh card every single time. Confirmed the
automated Top5+Favorites board (`board.py`) already dedupes correctly and was
not the problem.

**What changed:**
- New `docs/history-dedup.js` — a pure function `dedupeHistoryByLatest(snapshots,
  excludeIds)` that keeps each listing id's entry in only the newest snapshot
  that mentions it (snapshots are already sorted newest-first by
  `ingest_manual_shortlist.py`). `docs/history.json` and the ingest script are
  completely untouched — every dated mention stays in the JSON forever, only
  what the dashboard *renders* is deduped. `excludeIds` is also seeded with
  today's Top 5 + Favoritos ids, so a vehicle already shown up top doesn't also
  get a stale History card.
- No build tooling introduced: the new file works as a plain global `<script>`
  in the browser (loaded before `app.js` in `index.html`) AND as a
  `require()`-able Node module via a UMD-style guard — zero new dependencies.
  Covered by 5 new tests run via Node's built-in `node:test` runner
  (`tests/test_history_dedup.js`).
- `scripts/research-prompt.md` gained a new "Carrocería integral (Clase A)
  preferida sobre perfilada" bullet in Preferencias fuertes, plus a mention in
  the ranking-comparison list so it's actually applied, not just stated once.
  Explicitly a soft tiebreaker, not a filter — a standout perfilada deal wins
  exactly as before. `CLAUDE.md`'s rubric section got a synced clarifying note.
- **Real impact, measured against live `history.json`**: 15 dated sections
  collapsed to 7, and 79 entry cards collapsed to 28 — bigger than "one listing
  now shows once" might suggest, since several dates were entirely superseded
  by newer ones. Matches the approved design exactly (a date left with zero
  surviving entries after dedup disappears from the page), just a larger real
  effect than the ticket framing implied — flagged to Luis after deploy.
- **Validation**: 5/5 new JS tests + 50/50 existing pytest suite passed at every
  checkpoint. Pushed to `origin/main` and verified live via a real browser
  (playwriter): a listing previously repeated across 13 dates
  (`2dehands_be-f9438584`) now renders exactly once, under its latest date;
  `history.json` confirmed to still contain all 13 original mentions (data
  untouched). The integral preference will take effect on the next real Stage B
  run (tonight's 03:00 job) — not forced as part of this change.
- **Lesson for future `docs/` script-splitting**: right after this push, a
  browser with a cached `index.html` (GitHub Pages serves it with
  `cache-control: max-age=600`) paired with a freshly-fetched `app.js` would hit
  `ReferenceError: dedupeHistoryByLatest is not defined` inside `render()` and
  get stuck on "Cargando…" — because the cached HTML lacked the new
  `history-dedup.js` `<script>` tag. Resolved itself within ~10 minutes as caches
  expired, and doesn't apply retroactively to this change, but any future commit
  that adds a new `<script>` tag to `docs/index.html` has the same ≤10-minute
  mixed-version window. Not worth a defensive `typeof` guard for a single-user
  dashboard, but worth remembering if a "blank page right after deploy" report
  ever comes in.

## 2026-08-11 — Europe-wide search scope restored

Luis asked to widen the automated pipeline's search back to all of Europe —
the Canary Islands market is genuinely thin (~35-45 units per prior research),
and the real fix for recall is geography, not more Canary-specific sources.
Approved design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-europe-wide-search-restore-design.md`.

**Why:** the 2026-07-30 Canary-only refocus (see that entry below) was a
deliberate scope narrowing, not a mistake — but it left recall thin. Ported
forward rather than `git revert`ed, to keep every non-geography fix layered on
since (new+used search, Top5+Favorites model, discard defense-in-depth, hang
mitigation).

**What changed:**
- `scripts/harvest.py` — `fetch_milanuncios`/`fetch_coches_net` URLs back to
  nationwide Spain (no `/canarias.htm`, no `/canarias/`), re-verified live via
  curl before wiring in.
- `Resources/europe-motorhome-selling-sites.md` — un-superseded, restored as
  the active portal list; gained a new "New (0km) motorhomes" section
  (generalized from the Canary file's version) since new-vehicle search is
  now a permanent feature, not Canary-specific.
  `Resources/canary-motorhome-selling-sites.md` marked superseded in place,
  not deleted.
- `scripts/research-prompt.md` — Europe-wide geography/logistics language
  restored (buy anywhere in Europe, self-drive + Canary ferry leg only,
  IVA/IGIC import note). Hard gates, budget, no-body-type-filter,
  no-invented-scoring, and the new+used search instruction all unchanged.
- `scripts/weekly-search.sh` — Stage B scratch dir now copies
  `europe-motorhome-selling-sites.md`. Single 03:00 schedule, watchdog timeout,
  and the 03:20 Atlantic/Canary session-limit-reset risk are all unchanged.
- Docs: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` updated for consistency.
- Repo hygiene: deleted two confirmed-stale iCloud conflict copies
  (`docs/history 2.json`, `scripts/ingest_manual_shortlist 2.py`) after
  diffing them against their real counterparts (0 unique lines in either) and
  getting Luis's go-ahead.
- **Validation**: full test suite passed (including a new test pinning the
  restored URLs). Ran a real end-to-end pipeline pass (cleared today's
  `.state` marker first): Stage A harvested 86 candidates total (+8 new that
  run), spanning mainland Spain (Sevilla, Almería, La Rioja, Ávila, A Coruña,
  Madrid) plus Canarias — direct evidence the harvester itself is back to
  nationwide scope, not just Stage B's live search. Stage B's Top 5: 4x
  España (two in Tenerife, one Tenerife/Gran Canaria stock, one
  Madrid-with-Lisboa-registration) + 1x Alemania (a Bürstner Lyseo Harmony
  Line in Friedberg/Hessen, sourced from caraworld.de, with a live
  German-market price comparison in its own verdict) — the German winner is
  the clearest evidence Stage B genuinely searched Europe-wide, not just
  Spain. Stage D published clean: commit `1063937` ("chore: top 5 refresh
  2026-08-12"), pushed to `origin/main` and confirmed landed. Whole run took
  ~10 minutes, no FATAL, no watchdog hang. Spot-checked the live dashboard
  (via playwriter) ~ a few minutes after the push: the Top 5 section
  rendered all 5 cards correctly, including the Friedberg/Hessen (Germany)
  card, and the Favoritos section (7 starred listings spanning Fuerteventura,
  Tenerife, A Coruña, France, and Italy) rendered correctly too — no empty
  state, no JS error.

**Not part of this change** (explicitly out of scope per the design doc):
wider Stage B fetch budget, dedicated scrapers for more sources (mobile.de,
AutoScout24, etc. — still Stage B's live-search job), distance/shipping-cost
scoring.

## 2026-07-31 — manual search reports will keep including European finds

Luis, right after confirming the 2026-07-30 Canary-only refocus was working:
he will keep periodically supplying manual search reports (deep multi-portal
research pastes) for me to ingest via the existing manual-shortlist
history-view feature (`scripts/ingest_manual_shortlist.py` → `docs/history.json`,
see the 2026-07-27 entry below) — and these will likely still include
**European** finds, not just Canary Islands ones.

**Why:** the manual-shortlist path is deliberately separate from the automated
Top5+Favorites board (see 2026-07-26/2026-07-27 entries below) — it's Luis's
own periodic deep research covering sites the automated harvester/Stage B
can't reach. The 2026-07-30 refocus narrowed the *automated* pipeline's search
scope to the Canary Islands; it does not narrow what Luis pastes into the
manual history view. Don't assume a future manual shortlist should be
Canary-only just because the automated pipeline now is — the two paths
intentionally have different scopes and always have (see 2026-07-27 entry).

**How to apply:** when Luis pastes a new dated shortlist (however many islands
or countries it covers), transcribe it into `ingest_manual_shortlist.py`'s
`SHORTLISTS` dict as usual and re-run it — no scope filtering needed on the
manual path, regardless of what the automated pipeline is currently scoped to.

## 2026-07-30 refocus — Canary Islands only, new+used, single 03:00 run

Luis: "let's refocus this project on searching only for motorhomes in the Canary
Islands, both used and new. Extensive search. Updates the dashboard and runs once
a day at 3am." This reverts the geography half of the 2026-07-26 Europe-wide
rebuild (see that entry below) while keeping everything else it taught: no
body-type restriction, no invented percentage scoring, Top5+Favorites board model,
the Stage B hang mitigations. **New** relative to even the pre-2026-07-26
Canary-only rubric: that one was used-only; this one explicitly searches new
(0km/concesionario) stock too.

**Why:** Luis's direct instruction — no incident or external brief behind this
one, just a scope decision. (Contrast with the 2026-07-26 change, which was
driven by a separate Claude.ai Project brief.)

**What changed:**
- `scripts/harvest.py` — `fetch_milanuncios`/`fetch_coches_net` URLs switched back
  to their Canarias-filtered versions (`milanuncios.com/autocaravanas-de-segunda-mano/canarias.htm`,
  `coches.net/autocaravanas-y-remolques/canarias/`). The exact old Milanuncios URL
  and the old (pre-slug-rename) Coches.net URL were recovered from `git show
  b0ae4e6` (the commit that had widened them to nationwide); both Canarias URLs
  were then verified live via `curl` (200, real "Canarias"/"provincia" content,
  no bot-block stub) before landing in the scraper — didn't want to guess a filter
  URL and silently break Stage A the way a wrong selector has before.
- `Resources/canary-motorhome-selling-sites.md` — new file, replaces
  `europe-motorhome-selling-sites.md` in the active pipeline (that file is marked
  superseded at its own top, left in place, not deleted). Lists Canarias-filtered
  general marketplaces (Milanuncios, Coches.net, Wallapop, Autocasion, AutoScout24
  España), the two known Canary Islands dealers from this project's own history
  (RentCamper Canarias, Autocaravanas Canarias — real businesses, previously
  mandatory Stage B fetch targets before 2026-07-26), and — since there's no
  reliable static list of every new-vehicle dealer in the islands — explicit
  instructions for Stage B to actively WebSearch for concesionarios per island and
  per brand rather than waiting for one to turn up. No fictitious dealer names
  invented; anything not directly evidenced by project history is phrased as a
  live-search instruction, not a hardcoded URL.
- `scripts/research-prompt.md` — dropped the pan-European self-drive/ferry
  framing and the whole "IVA y Canarias" import-logic section (replaced with a
  short IGIC note: local Canary sales are already IGIC, not IVA, no import to
  reason about). Dropped the DE/FR/IT/NL search-term table (no longer needed).
  Added explicit "search new stock too, don't just wait for it" instructions.
  Kept unchanged: every hard gate (MAM ≤3,500 kg, length ≥6.90 m, twin beds +
  infill kit, LHD, ≥4 belted seats), the €50k-100k budget, the no-body-type-filter
  and no-invented-scoring decisions from 2026-07-26, the discard/blocklist
  cross-check mechanism, the model-family list (still pan-European brands, they're
  sold new in Canarias too), and the output JSON contract's field names (`country`
  now always "España", `vat_status` repurposed for IGIC but not renamed, to avoid
  touching `apply_winners.py`/`board.py`/`app.js`, none of which validate or
  render either field beyond passthrough — checked before deciding not to rename).
- **Schedule**: `launchd/com.openbob.motorhome-search-daily.plist` collapsed from
  three `StartCalendarInterval` entries (07:00 real run + 13:00/19:00 retries) to
  one (03:00), per Luis's explicit "once a day at 3am." Reinstalled live via
  `launchctl bootout` + `bootstrap` and verified the new single 03:00 interval is
  actually active (`launchctl print` showed the old 3-entry schedule until this).
  **Known risk, flagged but not resolved**: the 2026-07-27 entry below documents
  Claude's daily session-limit reset at **3:20am Atlantic/Canary** — Luis had
  specifically chosen 03:25 back then (5 min after reset) to dodge it. 03:00 is 20
  min *before* that reset. With the retry slots gone, a run that hits the limit at
  03:00 now has no same-day recovery — just no fresh board until the next 03:00.
  Implemented literally as asked (03:00, not 03:25) since that's what was
  requested; if the log starts showing session-limit failures at 03:00, the fix is
  a one-line Hour/Minute change in the plist.
- Docs updated for consistency: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` (both purpose/rubric/
  schedule/sources sections). The separate manual-shortlist history-view feature
  (`docs/history.json`, mobile.de/AutoScout24/etc. as sources a human pastes in
  by hand) was deliberately left untouched — it's an orthogonal, Luis-driven
  process, not part of the automated pipeline this refocus touches.
- **Validation**: ran the full test suite after the `harvest.py` URL changes (no
  test hardcodes the scrape URLs, only fingerprint/dedupe/blocklist logic, so no
  regressions expected) and did one real end-to-end pipeline run (deleted today's
  `.state` marker first, per the documented force-rerun procedure) to confirm
  Stage A-D actually produce and publish Canary Islands (new+used) results under
  the new prompt/sources before calling this done — see the run's own log /
  outcome for what it actually found.

## 2026-07-28 master portal list — Resources/europe-motorhome-selling-sites.md

**Superseded 2026-07-30** — this section describes the Europe-wide portal list,
replaced by `canary-motorhome-selling-sites.md`. Left below as history.

Luis added `Resources/europe-motorhome-selling-sites.md` — a much more exhaustive
Europe-wide list of motorhome-selling sites (60+, organized by country, plus a
"Best sites to search first" priority sub-list) — and asked that Stage B search
through these sites, in order, on every run instead of the shorter ad hoc portal
list that had been embedded directly in `research-prompt.md`'s prose.

Wired in two places:
- `scripts/weekly-search.sh` now copies the file into the Stage B scratch dir
  (alongside `candidates.json`/`config.js`) since Stage B runs isolated from the
  repo (see the 2026-07-23 hang fix below) and would otherwise have no way to
  read it.
- `scripts/research-prompt.md` step 2 now tells Stage B to open that file and
  work through it in the order it's written — priority list first, then country
  sections in file order — rather than trusting Stage B to invent its own portal
  list from memory each run. Existing per-portal/total fetch budget (2 WebSearch +
  3 WebFetch per portal, ~25-30 fetches total) is unchanged — with 60+ sites now
  listed, the budget (not the site count) is what actually bounds a run.

To add/remove sites going forward, edit the Resources file, not
`research-prompt.md` — the prompt just points at it now.

## 2026-07-23 watchdog follow-up — capture diagnostics before killing

Luis pushed back correctly: a watchdog that kills a hang every run isn't a fix if the
hang itself is unexplained. Both prior hangs (2026-07-20, 2026-07-23) got killed before
anyone captured what the process was actually stuck on — so root cause was never more
than a guess (iCloud placeholder eviction vs. an internal CLI deadlock, see below).
Added: right before the watchdog kills a timed-out `claude -p`, it now runs
`sample "$CLAUDE_PID" 5 -file .state/hang-sample-<timestamp>.txt` — dumps every
thread's call stack while the process is still suspended, no sudo needed for a
same-user process (verified: `sample $$ 1 -file ...` on the shell itself worked
cleanly). Next hang should leave an actual answer instead of just a corpse.

## 2026-07-23 second Stage B hang — added a watchdog (permanent fix)

Manually triggered the daily search; Stage B (`claude -p`) hung again — same signature
as the 2026-07-20 incident (0% CPU, zero open network connections, no session
transcript ever created under `~/.claude/projects/...`), this time for 4h17m before
noticed. Killed the process tree on Luis's authorization, reran `weekly-search.sh`
manually — completed cleanly in 6.5 min, published board for 2026-W30, commit
`2066a11` pushed.

Since this is now a repeat (not a one-off), added an actual fix instead of relying on
manual detection again:
- `scripts/weekly-search.sh` Stage B now runs `claude -p` in the background under a
  plain-bash watchdog (`STAGE_B_TIMEOUT=1500`, 25 min) that kills it on expiry. No
  `timeout`/`gtimeout` binary is installed on this Mac, hence a manual poll loop
  instead of a one-liner.
- A killed hang now falls through to the same "no winners.json → exit 2" path as any
  other Stage B failure, so the existing 13:00/19:00 daily retry slots recover from it
  automatically — no more silent multi-hour freeze waiting on a human to notice.
- Root cause is still **unconfirmed**. Ruled out: session-limit failure (exits
  cleanly, doesn't match), missing `--allowedTools` permission prompt (already set,
  designed for exactly this headless case). Leading candidates: iCloud placeholder
  eviction blocking a synchronous file read (this repo lives under
  `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/`, a known-accepted risk since the
  2026-07-20 consolidation), or an internal Claude Code CLI deadlock. If it recurs
  despite the watchdog now bounding the damage, next diagnostic step is `fs_usage` or
  `dtruss` on the stuck PID to see the exact blocked syscall.
- See also `CLAUDE.md` "Things that will bite you" — updated in the same pass.

## 2026-07-21 schedule change — Monday-only to daily

Luis asked to run the search daily instead of once a week. Clarified scope first since
the board is fundamentally WEEK-keyed (`board.py`: one position per ISO week) — two
readings existed: (a) refresh the current week's Top 5 daily, keeping week-grouping as
the UI model, or (b) switch the board itself to day-keyed sections. Luis chose (a).

- `board.py` / dashboard model: **unchanged**. Still one card per vehicle, positioned by
  the most recent ISO week it won. A same-week rerun just promotes into that week's
  existing entries — the cross-source dedup added earlier the same week (`same_vehicle`)
  applies here too, so daily reruns don't create duplicates either.
- `scripts/weekly-search.sh`: idempotency marker changed from `.state/<week>.done` to
  `.state/<date>.done` — was blocking every run after the first success of the week
  (by design, before this change); now blocks only repeats within the same calendar day.
  Commit message now includes the date (`chore: top 5 refresh <date> (week <week>)`) so
  daily republishes are distinguishable in git log.
- launchd: `com.openbob.motorhome-search-weekly` renamed to
  `com.openbob.motorhome-search-daily` (plist file, Label, log file all renamed to
  match); `StartCalendarInterval` dropped its `Weekday` key so all three slots
  (07:00/13:00/19:00 — the same retry pattern proven necessary the day before, see the
  hang incident below) fire every day instead of only Monday.
- **Cost/usage note:** this is up to 3x/day `claude -p` Stage B invocations now, not up
  to 3x/week — a real multiplier on Claude session usage. Worth watching if session
  limits start getting hit more often; the market itself (35-45 units total) barely
  turns over daily, so most days will republish the same winners and cost a research
  pass without changing what the family sees.

## 2026-07-20 consolidation — Motorhome_HQ/Motorhome_Search

The project had split into two diverged locations:
- `~/Developer/Manual Search Script Run/` — the actual canonical, deployable code.
- `AI Coworking/01_Personal_HQ/Projects/Assets_HQ/Camper_Lifestyle/` — an independent
  clone of the same GitHub remote, frozen on a 3-commit history from the 2026-05-19
  force-push incident (see below). Its own `CLAUDE.md` had been rewritten in place to
  flag itself as a dead clone, but that edit was never committed.

Consolidated into one canonical location, matching the existing `<Category_HQ>/<Project>/`
convention already used by `Assets_HQ/BSA_Options`:
- New path: `01_Personal_HQ/Projects/Motorhome_HQ/Motorhome_Search/` (this repo).
- GitHub repo renamed `Camper_Lifestyle` → `Motorhome_Search` (`gh repo rename`).
  Pages URL is now https://commanderwi11.github.io/Motorhome_Search/
- launchd job renamed `com.openbob.camper-weekly` → `com.openbob.motorhome-search-weekly`;
  log renamed `camper-weekly.log` → `motorhome-weekly.log`.
- Display/product name in the dashboard UI and docs is "Motorhome Lifestyle"; the
  folder/repo machine name is "Motorhome_Search" — mirrors the old
  folder-`Camper_Lifestyle`-displays-as-"Camper Life-style" pattern.
- Supabase table names (`camper_*`) were left unchanged — Supabase is dead anyway
  (see below), renaming would need a live migration for zero benefit.
- Original design docs (2026-05-11 plan + spec) preserved under
  `Resources/design-history/` — they only existed in the stale AI Coworking clone.
- Old clone archived at `Assets_HQ/Camper_Lifestyle_ARCHIVED_2026-07-20/`, then
  permanently deleted the same night once Luis confirmed nothing more was needed
  from it (everything of value was already merged in above).
- **iCloud risk accepted knowingly:** this repo now lives inside iCloud Drive
  (AI Coworking is under `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/`). iCloud can
  evict local files to cloud-only placeholders between runs, which could break the
  unattended 07:00 Monday launchd run. Raised explicitly with Luis during planning;
  he chose to accept the risk rather than pin the folder "Keep Downloaded".

### Same-day incident: 19:00 retry hung, not failed
The 07:00 run on 2026-07-20 hit a Claude session limit (clean failure, no marker
written, correctly queued for retry). The 19:00 retry (last scheduled slot of the day)
instead **hung**: 2.5 hours elapsed, 0.19s total CPU time, zero open network
connections, and — the tell — **no Claude session transcript file was ever created**
under `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` for the whole run. A real `claude -p`
run writes to its session file continuously; total silence there (not just low CPU) is
the reliable signal of a true hang vs. a slow-but-working run. Killed the process tree
(`kill -TERM` on the `weekly-search.sh` PID and the `claude -p` child) and reran
`weekly-search.sh` manually — the manual run completed cleanly (`2026-W30.done`
written, board published, commit `63caf57` pushed) in well under the time the hung run
had already burned.

### Same-day fix: cross-source duplicate cards (commit a97152d)
Luis spotted it directly: the same physical **Etrusco 7400SB** was on the board twice
(`coches_net-0caa3cc4` week W29, `milanuncios-dcc75ac8` week W30) — same van, two ids,
because ids are `md5(source+url)` and the same vehicle gets a fresh id on every site it's
relisted on. The existing `fingerprint()` (exact token-set match) didn't catch it: one
title tokenized "7400 SB" as two tokens, the other tokenized "7400SB" as one, and the
descriptive words never overlapped at all ("garaje grande" vs "camas gemelas fijas").
Root-caused, fixed, and merged the live duplicate the same night:
- `_slug_tokens` now splits letter/digit runs so model codes match regardless of
  spacing ("7400SB" -> "7400"+"sb", same as "7400 SB").
- `_FP_STOPWORDS` expanded to drop base-chassis brands (fiat, ducato, ford, transit...)
  and engine/sale-status words (jtd, td, reservada...) — these were the dominant
  false-positive source (nearly every integral/perfilada shares a Fiat Ducato chassis,
  so two *different* models were sharing 4-6 "identity" tokens before this).
- New `harvest.same_vehicle(a, b)`: cross-source only (a dealer's own catalog can
  legitimately carry two units of one model — same-source near-dupes are never merged)
  plus a real token-overlap threshold, calibrated against the actual live dataset
  (candidates.json + board) to confirm zero false positives before shipping.
- `board.update_board()` now promotes into the existing card via `same_vehicle`, keeping
  the original id (so Supabase stars/comments/discards stay attached correctly).
- `apply_winners.py` now refuses to publish a week whose winners contain the same
  vehicle twice from different sources (a research-pass bug, not two real vans).
- Also: the dashboard's "✨ Nuevo" ribbon was purely session/visit-based (only showed
  on listings added since your last browser visit) — now `added_at` within the current
  top week always marks a card new, regardless of visit history or cleared localStorage.
- 9 new tests in `tests/test_harvest.py`, `test_board.py`, `test_apply_winners.py`
  pin down the real Etrusco case as a true positive and same-source/shared-chassis/
  conflicting-year cases as false-positive guards.

## 2026-05-24 recall improvements
Result: total dataset now ~5-6 motorhomes/run (vs. ~3 pre-pivot). Smaller gain than expected because Canary Islands market is genuinely thin.
- **Coches.net added** — heavy bot-detection, needs a humanlike browser context (locale/timezone/viewport + `navigator.webdriver` override). Pagination unreliable; single page only. Yields ~3-6 cards/run.
- **Autoscout24 dropped** — confirmed zero Spanish motorhomes on AS24.
- **Autocasion tried, dropped** — location filters are broken; returns nationwide listings regardless of param. No working Canarias filter exists.
- **Wallapop kept strict** — non-strict mode pulled 120 listings of which 95% were cars, real estate, and vans. Strict + brand whitelist is the right balance.
- **Brand whitelist** covers premium integral/perfilada manufacturers (hymer, bürstner, carthago, concorde, frankia, niesmann, morelo, benimar, chausson, adria matrix, dethleffs, etc.).
- **Key learning:** Wallapop is a keyword-fuzzy-match platform — non-strict mode is unworkable. Coches.net has aggressive bot detection. Autocasion's location filter is broken. Canary Islands motorhome supply is genuinely small (~10-15 active listings across all platforms at any time, later refined to 35-45 units across the whole archipelago once more sources were added — see harvest.py sources).

## 2026-05-24 pivot — integrales y perfiladas
- Family preference shifted away from camper-vans to **integrales** (Class-A coachbuilt) and **perfiladas** (low-profile). Vans, capuchinas, alcoba dropped.
- Price ceiling raised €55,000 → **€100,000** to capture this segment.
- Weight cap **kept at 3,500 kg** (B-licence constraint).
- Reference model updated from Sunlight Cliff (van) to Concorde Liner (gold-standard European integral).

## 2026-05-20 incident (the force-push that caused the later split)
- GitHub Pages was off (repo had been switched to private; free plan blocks Pages on private repos).
- Repo made public again; Pages re-enabled in legacy mode serving `main:/docs`.
- Remote `main` had been force-rewritten on 2026-05-15 to a fresh 3-commit history that wiped the May 12 triage/favorites/Autoscout24/hide-listings work. Local (`~/Developer/Manual Search Script Run/`) was canonical → force-pushed to restore.
- This is why the AI Coworking clone existed as a separate, never-updated copy of the pre-force-push-restore state for two months, until the 2026-07-20 consolidation above.

## 2026-07-26 rebuild — Europe-wide brief, Top 5 + Favorites, hang fix
Luis wanted the dashboard redone (simpler, better-looking) and pointed out the real
search criteria live in a *different* brief than this repo's rubric: a separate
Claude.ai Project (`motorhome-search-brief_2.md`) targeting **all of Europe** (buy
anywhere, self-drive it back as a road trip, ferry only the Canary leg — no
distance/shipping-cost penalty by country), not Canary-only stock. That brief is now
the single source of truth, replacing the old Canary-only rubric in
`scripts/research-prompt.md`.

**What changed:**
- **Rubric**: length flipped ≤7m→**≥6.90m** (easy to get backwards — flagged explicitly
  in the prompt), added **LHD** and twin-rear-beds-with-infill-kit as hard gates,
  dropped bathroom/geography as hard gates (now preferences), budget floor
  €20k→€50k, scope widened to mobile.de/AutoScout24/leboncoin/Subito.it/CamperOnLine/
  Marktplaats/OLX via Stage B live search (no dedicated scrapers yet — that's Phase 2).
- **Board model**: dropped the ISO-week archive entirely. `board.py` now does Top 5
  (today, rank 1-5) + Favorites (starred, rank null) — nothing else persists. A
  dropped, unstarred winner just disappears on the next run.
- **Dashboard**: rebuilt from scratch **twice** in one session — first pass kept too
  much of the old visual DNA (navy header, chip badges, overlay icons) and Luis said
  so directly ("looks exactly like the old one"); second pass is genuinely new: cream
  background, teal price accent, minimal cards with ONLY photo/title-link/star/delete/
  price/size/mileage/location — no verdict, flags, spec chips, comments, or status
  triage on the card. Lesson: "simpler" instructions this literal need a literal
  field-by-field rebuild, not a restyle of the existing structure.
- **Supabase**: `harvest.py` already had a dormant `camper_hidden`→blocklist bridge
  (`_supabase_blocklist()`) that just needed a live project to reactivate — added the
  missing other half, `_supabase_starred()`/`load_starred()` (mirrors the blocklist
  pattern, local `scripts/starred.json` cache so a Supabase outage doesn't wipe
  Favorites). Re-provisioning itself needs Luis to complete an OAuth flow via the
  connected Supabase MCP (`mcp__plugin_supabase_supabase__authenticate`) — was still
  pending his approval as of session end; `docs/config.js` needs the new URL/anon key
  once that lands.
- **Stage B hang**: 7 consecutive scheduled runs (07-20 through 07-26) hit the 25-min
  watchdog, every hang-sample showing an identical `getcwd()`/`open_nocancel` stall at
  process startup. A live interactive `claude -p "OK"` from the same iCloud repo cwd
  does NOT reproduce it (~5s response) — so it's specific to the cold/unattended
  launchd context, not a blanket "this cwd always hangs" fact. Mitigation applied
  regardless (cheap and safe either way): `weekly-search.sh` now runs the `claude -p`
  subprocess itself from a local non-iCloud scratch dir
  (`~/Library/Application Support/motorhome-search/stage-b-scratch/`) via
  `( cd "$SCRATCH" && exec claude -p ... )`, copying `candidates.json` in and
  `winners.json` back out. Stage A/C/D untouched (they've never hung). Not yet
  confirmed fixed by a real scheduled run — check `.state/hang-sample-*.txt` next time
  it fires to see if new samples appear.
- `docs/listings.json` reset to `[]` (old Canary-only board entries not worth
  migrating under a fully different rubric). `tests/test_board.py` and
  `tests/test_apply_winners.py` rewritten for the new model; 56 tests passing.
- Deleted stray `docs/superpowers/specs/*.md` (a design doc that was sitting inside
  the served Pages root by accident).

**First real run (same day, 13:47-14:00)**: manually kicked off right after the
rebuild. Stage B completed in 651s from the new scratch dir (vs. 7 straight hangs at
25min before the fix) — first evidence the hang fix works, not yet confirmed by an
actual unattended scheduled run. Stage C then rejected the output: `same_vehicle()`
false-positived a Giottiline Toscan 69GC against an unrelated Challenger Fiat C387,
both merely sharing generic layout words ("camas", "gemelas", "estrenar") that the
new brief's richer title style introduces into nearly every listing now. Fixed by
expanding `_FP_STOPWORDS` in `harvest.py` with the new shared vocabulary (camas,
gemelas, garaje, kit, separado, estrenar, etc.) — verified the specific collision
resolves and all 56 tests still pass. Re-ran Stage C against the already-captured
winners.json (no need to re-run the expensive Stage B) and published for real: 5
winners, Spain + France, top pick an Etrusco 7400SB already in Tenerife (€64,900).
Emailed to luisnavm@gmail.com. If `same_vehicle` false-positives again, the
stopword list in `harvest.py` (`_FP_STOPWORDS`) is the first place to look —
generic spec/layout vocabulary shared across most listings under the new rubric is
the recurring risk, not brand/model collisions.

**Same-day follow-up correction**: Luis pointed out the rewrite still carried old
Canary-rubric parameters despite the brief not asking for them. Two real leftovers,
both fixed:
1. `research-prompt.md` had an invented 35/30/20/15 percentage-weighted scoring
   rubric — structurally copied from the OLD rubric's 40/35/15/10, but the brief
   itself only says "rank by overall value" with no formula. Replaced with holistic
   judgment instructions, no weights.
2. `harvest.py` still hard-rejected capuchinas/campervans and required
   integral/perfilada (`_ACCEPT_RE`/`_REJECT_RE`) — an old-rubric body-type
   restriction the brief never asked for. Removed entirely; `_is_target()` no
   longer filters on body type, `_BRAND_RE` now matches only the brief's own §5
   model-family list (dropped carthago/frankia/concorde/niesmann/morelo/sun
   living/pilote/mclouis/laika — none are in the brief). Also added the explicit
   €50k-100k budget statement to the prompt (it was missing from the prompt text
   itself, only enforced via params.json's Stage A gates, which don't constrain
   Stage B's own live Europe-wide search at all).

**Lesson for future edits to this project**: when adapting the old
Canary-only-rubric prompt/scraper into a new brief, structural habits (weighted
scoring, body-type gates) carry over silently even when the explicit numbers are
updated. Cross-check every filter/gate in both `research-prompt.md` AND
`harvest.py` against the actual brief text, not just against "what looks similar
to before."

## Same-day third correction — sources, age, budget

Luis, again: "you are still holding parameters from the old project in searches...
use exclusively the following." A third read-only audit found the real remaining
issue: **sources**, not just gates/weights this time.

`harvest.py`'s `SOURCES` hit 7 sites; the brief's §5 portal list for Spain names
only Milanuncios/Coches.net/Autocasion. Wallapop, Autocaravanas DM, Mundo
Autocaravanas, Campermax, caravanas.net were never in the brief at all — leftover
from the old Canary-only project's own source discovery (Mundo Autocaravanas alone
was 34/80 = 43% of the candidate pool). `research-prompt.md` additionally
hard-coded RentCamper Canarias + Autocaravanas Canarias as *mandatory* Stage B
fetches every run (calling RentCamper "our single best family source" — old-rubric
evaluation language), and told Stage B all 7 harvester sources "siguen siendo
candidatos válidos" — actively re-legitimizing them instead of flagging the gap.

Also found: `max_age_years: 15` was a hard Stage-A reject with no brief basis,
directly contradicting the brief's "never discard on mileage/age alone." And
budget (`min_price`/`max_price`) was *also* a hard Stage-A reject, despite living
in the brief's "Parameters" section (§1), not its explicit 5-item "reject anything
that fails these" table (§2) — same category as height, which the brief
explicitly says is "not a constraint." Real proof the intended behavior was
already soft: the current #5 winner (€41,990 Challenger, 16% under the 50k floor)
was included by Stage B with a disclosure flag — but only because it came from
Stage B's own live search, bypassing Stage A's hard gate. An identical candidate
from Milanuncios/Coches.net would have been silently dropped.

**Fixed, user chose the strict option** (remove all 7 non-brief sources rather
than keep them relabeled as "extra"): `harvest.py` now only scrapes Milanuncios +
Coches.net, both widened from Canarias-only URLs to nationwide Spain
(`milanuncios.com/autocaravanas-de-segunda-mano/` no suffix;
`coches.net/autocaravanas-y-remolques/` — note this category slug was renamed
from `autocaravanas-segunda-mano`, the old path only still works via redirect).
`fetch_wallapop`/`fetch_autocaravanas_dm`/`fetch_mundo_autocaravanas`/
`fetch_campermax`/`fetch_caravanas_net` deleted entirely, along with `_is_target`'s
strict/brand-whitelist mode (`_BRAND_RE`) since Wallapop was its only caller,
`_passes_age`/`apply_price_filter` (no longer enforced — Stage B judges age/price
holistically per the brief), and now-dead helpers (`_parse_attrs`, `_soup`,
`_price_from`, `_ancestor_text`, `_blank`, `JSON_HEADERS`). `params.json` lost
`max_age_years` and the Wallapop geo-filter. `research-prompt.md` lost the
mandatory RentCamper/Autocaravanas Canarias section and the "still valid
candidates" framing for the 5 removed sources. One-off cleanup: purged 66 stale
non-brief entries from `scripts/candidates.json` (80→14; verified live re-run
afterward: 22, all `milanuncios`/`coches_net`). 47 tests pass (down from 56 — 9
removed for deleted functionality, none rewritten to fake-cover dead code).

**Pattern across all three corrections today**: each fix surfaced a NEW category
of old-project leftover the previous audit missed (invented scoring → body-type
filter → non-brief sources/gates). If a fourth complaint comes in, audit
`scripts/apply_winners.py`'s `validate()` and `scripts/board.py` next — not yet
audited for old-rubric assumptions as thoroughly as `harvest.py`/
`research-prompt.md` were across these three passes.

## Live URLs
- **Dashboard:** https://commanderwi11.github.io/Motorhome_Search/
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/CommanderWi11/Motorhome_Search

## Key decisions
- Single canonical location: `01_Personal_HQ/Projects/Motorhome_HQ/Motorhome_Search/` — code, docs, and dashboard together, no separate "planning only" copy elsewhere.
- GitHub Pages serves `docs/` folder from `main` branch (legacy mode, no Actions).
- Supabase: re-provisioned 2026-07-26 (new project "motorhome-search", org "Alfred Org", eu-central-1) after the old Family_Plan project was deleted — live, `docs/config.js` has current credentials. Tables still prefixed `camper_*`.
- `docs/listings.json` is Top 5 (today) + Favorites (starred), not an accumulating feed or week-archive — see "The rubric"/pipeline section of `CLAUDE.md` for the current model. (Superseded 2026-07-26; don't trust older "ISO-week board" language if it resurfaces anywhere.)

## Sources
Current, authoritative list lives in `CLAUDE.md`'s "The rubric" section (kept in one place deliberately, since this list has changed 3+ times — duplicating it here just risks the copy going stale again, which is exactly what happened to the pre-2026-07-26 version of this section).

## Open loops
- GitHub Actions cannot run this pipeline (datacenter IP block) — always runs via local launchd.
- `scripts/apply_winners.py`/`scripts/board.py` still not audited as thoroughly against the brief as `harvest.py`/`research-prompt.md` (see the 2026-07-26 entry above) — next place to look if a further "old parameters" complaint arises.
- `harvest.py`'s `fetch_coches_net` location extraction (`CANARY_KEYWORDS`-based) was never generalized for nationwide-Spain scope — flagged in the final review of the 2026-08-11 Europe-wide restore. Measured against that restore's own first live run: 44 of 58 coches.net candidates landed with `location: ""` (mainland cities like Sevilla, A Coruña, Valencia, Asturias, Granada, Madrid all miss the Canary-keyword heuristic), vs. 0 empty for milanuncios. Not a regression from that restore — this is pre-existing code, unchanged since before it, and behaved the same way during the 2026-07-26 Europe-wide period too. Stage B's own detail-page fetch backfills location for winners, so it's masked at the board level, but the raw candidate pool is degraded. Deliberately not fixed as part of that restore (real code change, deserves its own test, and the design spec for that restore explicitly scoped out deeper Stage A engineering work) — worth a small follow-up: fall back to any `(Provincia)`-shaped line in the card text, not just Canary place-names.

## 2026-07-27 — live 3:25am run + manual-shortlist history view

**`claude -p` session limit discovery**: a premature manual `launchctl kickstart`
at 00:36 hit "You've hit your session limit · resets 3:20am (Atlantic/Canary)"
and failed cleanly (no publish, no `.done` marker written). This is exactly why
Luis asked for the run at 3:25am specifically — 5 min after the daily reset.
Re-ran at 03:25:07, succeeded in ~9 min: first live confirmation the 2026-07-26
brief-only sourcing fix (commit `b0ae4e6`) holds end-to-end — Stage A pulled 36
candidates from only `milanuncios`/`coches_net`, board published a Top 3
(Challenger 287 GA, Etrusco 7400SB, Laika Kosmo 209).

**Tooling note**: this session's safety-classifier gate intermittently failed
(generic "temporarily unavailable" error) specifically on CronCreate and on
Bash/Monitor calls that referenced `launchctl kickstart` inside a long
backgrounded/scheduled script — even though the bare foreground command
(`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.openbob.motorhome-search-daily`) and
plain backgrounded wait-loops with no `launchctl` text both worked fine every
time. Workaround used: a background wait-loop with no system-command text as
the "alarm," then run the real command in foreground once woken. If a future
session hits the same wall scheduling anything with launchctl, try that split
before assuming the whole classifier is down.

**Manual-shortlist history view** (feature, see `CLAUDE.md` for the technical
writeup): Luis pastes dated Top-5 markdown shortlists from deep multi-portal
research (mobile.de, AutoScout24, leboncoin, Marktplaats, Subito, individual
dealer sites — everything the automated harvester can't reach) periodically,
not on a fixed cadence. Asked (via AskUserQuestion) whether 3 such dated
reports (07-24/07-25/07-27) should merge into today's board, only the latest
should count, or all should show as a per-date history — chose **history
view**, explicitly reversing the earlier 2026-07-26 decision to drop
week-archiving from the *automated* board. Built as a wholly separate,
additive path (`docs/history.json` + `scripts/ingest_manual_shortlist.py`) so
it doesn't reopen that automated-board decision at all.
**Why:** the source markdown consistently arrives with OCR/copy corruption in
some cells and URLs (e.g. `caravan-wendt.darado-t-328...` missing
`.de/de/fahrzeuge/c`) — cross-referencing later reports' mentions of the same
still-live listing (explicitly called out as "held over unchanged") was enough
to reconstruct every one this round, but a future batch might have a
corruption with no clean copy anywhere — flag that to Luis rather than
guessing a URL completion.
**How to apply:** next time Luis pastes a new dated shortlist, transcribe it
by hand into `scripts/ingest_manual_shortlist.py`'s `SHORTLISTS` dict (don't
build a markdown-table parser — the corruption makes that fragile) and re-run
it; it's idempotent per date.
**Not done**: live visual QA of the new history section in a real browser —
both playwriter and the claude-in-chrome extension were disconnected during
this (very early morning, unattended) session. Verified instead via full
manual code review, JSON validation, `node --check`, and the 47-test suite
(unaffected, since this is additive). Worth an actual look next time Luis is
at the machine.

## 2026-07-28 — discard promise didn't cover Stage B, fixed in two passes

Luis starred a history-view listing earlier (fixed separately, see prior
entry — Favoritos only looked at `allListings`). Later he discarded a
*different* listing off the live automated board: the Challenger 287 GA
Special Edition (netcampers_fr, €41,990, the below-budget standout). Next
"run a search" hit `FATAL: refusing to publish — netcampers_fr-de4813bc was
discarded by the family but came back as a winner` — twice in a row, each
costing a full ~12-13min Stage B run, because of a real gap: **the 🗑 button's
"never search for it again" promise only ever covered `harvest.py`
(candidates.json filtering).** Stage B's own live Europe-wide WebSearch has
zero visibility into discards — it happily re-finds and re-ranks a
genuinely great deal the family already said no to.

**Fix, two layers (defense in depth, since Stage B is an LLM and prompt
compliance isn't a guarantee):**
1. `research-prompt.md` now has Stage B `curl` the Supabase `camper_hidden`
   table (via `docs/config.js`'s public anon key, copied into the Stage B
   scratch dir by `weekly-search.sh` alongside `candidates.json`) and drop
   any finalist whose id matches. **First attempt at this had a real bug**:
   the instruction said to check "id or URL" against the id list — nonsense,
   since a URL can never equal a hash-id. Had to add an explicit
   id-computation snippet (`hashlib.md5(url).hexdigest()[:8]`, same scheme as
   `harvest.make_id`) for candidates Stage B finds itself (blank `id` field).
2. Even with that fixed, **the exact same vehicle collided a second time**
   the same day — Stage B found it relisted on **leboncoin** instead of
   netcampers_fr, a totally different id (id = md5 of URL, so a different
   URL always means a different id). Pure id-blocking architecturally cannot
   catch a relist. Real fix: `apply_winners.py`'s `validate()` now also
   cross-checks every winner against `same_vehicle()` (existing cross-source
   title/year fuzzy-match, already used for on-board dedup) for every known
   listing behind a blocked id — drawn from `candidates.json` +
   `listings.json` + `history.json`. Deliberately uses the looser
   `same_vehicle()`, not the strict `fingerprint()` that `harvest.py`'s own
   blocklist propagation uses — the asymmetry is intentional: publishing a
   discarded vehicle breaks an explicit trust promise, while over-matching
   here just costs one rank slot for a day.
3. **Also made a blocked winner non-fatal**: `validate()` used to abort the
   *entire* run on any blocked-id collision. Now it drops just that one
   winner and renumbers the rest (rank gaps only allowed when something was
   actually dropped — Stage B assigning non-consecutive ranks on its own is
   still a hard failure, that's a real quality signal). One bad entry now
   costs a rank slot, not a wasted ~12min Stage B run and a stale board.

**Gotcha hit while fixing this**: testing the fix by manually re-running
`apply_winners.py` against the same `winners.json` TWICE (once before the
same_vehicle fix landed) meant the first run's `board.update_board()` had
already dropped the blocked listing's title/year out of `listings.json`
(it wasn't a winner that pass, wasn't starred) — so the second run's
`blocked_listings()` had nothing left to `same_vehicle()`-match against.
Not a real bug: in a single normal pipeline pass, `validate()` reads the old
board BEFORE `board.update_board()` overwrites it, so the data is always
there when needed. Just a self-inflicted artifact of iterating on the fix
live against real files — if this ever needs re-testing, do it against a
fresh copy of winners.json, not by re-running apply_winners.py serially
against files it already mutated.

Net effect published this run: board dropped from the Stage-B-proposed 4 to
3 (Etrusco 7400SB, Hymer/Carado T448, Laika Kosmo 209) — Challenger correctly
excluded either way.
